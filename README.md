# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project 🌍

## 💻 Project Overview
As a **Computer Engineering Student**, I developed this project to demonstrate a complete data lifecycle. I transformed raw global health data into an interactive visual story using a structured technical pipeline.

## 🏗️ Project Structure
* **[sql/](./sql/):** Contains the T-SQL scripts for data exploration, including CTEs, Joins, and Window Functions.
* **[data/](./data/):** Cleaned datasets (originally processed in Excel).
* **[tableau/](./tableau/):** High-resolution export of the final dashboard.
* **[screenshots/](./screenshots/):** Visual evidence of the SQL environment and query results.

## 🛠️ The Technical Pipeline
1. **Pre-processing:** Cleaned raw data in **Excel** to handle missing values and remove redundant features.
2. **Exploration:** Imported data into **MS SQL Server** for advanced querying.
3. **Visualization:** Connected the processed SQL data to **Tableau** for trend analysis.
