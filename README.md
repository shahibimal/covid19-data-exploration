# **Global COVID-19: Mortality & Vaccination Analysis** 🌍
### **📌 Project Overview**
This project focuses on extracting actionable insights from global COVID-19 data. I used SQL (T-SQL) to transform raw healthcare data into structured datasets, focusing on mortality rates and vaccination progress. The final stage involves an interactive Tableau Dashboard to visualize these trends for better decision-making.

### **📁 Project Structure**
* **[📂 /sql](./sql)** – SQL queries used for data exploration and analysis (**joins, CTEs, window functions**) and visualization-ready data transformation.
* **[📂 /data](./data)** – COVID-19 datasets (Excel format) used for analysis.
* **[📂 /dashboard](./dashboard)** – Tableau dashboard files and exported visuals.

### **🛠️ Tools & Technologies**
**MS SQL Server** – Heavy lifting for data joining, filtering, and aggregation.

**Tableau** – Building interactive BI dashboards for stakeholder reporting.

**Microsoft Excel** – Initial data quality checks and schema inspection.

### **🔍 Key Analysis Performed**
**Clinical Metrics**: Calculated Case Fatality Rates (CFR) and Population Infection Percentages.

**Global Hotspots**: Identified countries with the highest infection and death counts relative to population.

**Vaccination Velocity**: Used Rolling Totals to track the speed of vaccine rollouts globally.

**Time-Series Analysis**: Comparison of infection waves vs. vaccination milestones.

### **📊 Visualization**
The SQL results were connected to Tableau to create an interactive dashboard showing:
* Global trends
* Country-level comparisons
* Vaccination progress over time

### **📌 Notes**
* Dataset timeline is up to 2021.
* Project is based on publicly available COVID-19 data.
* This project focuses on **learning and demonstrating SQL + Tableau skills**.
